  <p>Hello <%= @seller.name_or_username %>,</p>
  <p>We wanted to inform you that PayPal has suspended Gumroad's use of their service. As a result, we can no longer process payouts to PayPal accounts.</p>
  <p>We've invested heavily in direct bank transfers for nearly every country. We encourage you to connect a bank account directly to your Gumroad account to ensure uninterrupted payouts.</p>

  <p>
    To update your payout method:
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to your Gumroad account</li>
      <li>Go to Settings > Payments</li>
      <li>Choose "Bank Account" under "Payout method"</li>
      <li>Enter your bank account details and submit</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>If you're based in a country where we don't yet support direct bank transfers (such as Brazil), you can change your country to one where you have identity verification and a bank account. This will allow you to receive payouts through direct bank transfer.</p>
  <p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Our team is working diligently to ensure smooth payouts for all our creators.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your understanding and continued support.</p>
  <p>
    Best regards,
    <br>
    The Gumroad Team

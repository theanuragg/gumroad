  <p>Hey <%= @seller.name_or_username %>,</p>
  <p>
    We'll soon unify your refund policies. Instead of each product having its own policy, all your products will now use a single account-level policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of becoming a <a href="https://gumroad.gumroad.com/p/gumroad-is-becoming-a-merchant-of-record-more-updates" target="_blank">Merchant of Record</a>,
    starting January, every product will follow the same refund policy for new purchases.
    <br>
    It also means that—soon—we'll be able to handle refund requests on your behalf, saving you time and energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two refund policy options will be available:
    <ul>
      <li>30-day money back guarantee (default)</li>
      <li>No refunds allowed</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>No action is needed</b>—we'll notify you in January once your account is migrated.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>
  <p>
    <strong>What will be my default refund policy?</strong><br>
    If all your products have a <em>no refunds</em> policy, we'll use that as your default. Otherwise, we'll use the <em>30-day money back guarantee</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I set different refund policies for different products?</strong><br>
    No, all your products will share the same refund policy to simplify the experience for you and your customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What happens to existing purchases?</strong><br>
    Purchases made before this change will keep their original refund policy that was in place at the time of purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I change my refund policy later?</strong><br>
    Yes, you can switch between the two options anytime after migration. The new policy will apply to all new purchases.

  <p>Hey <%= @seller.name_or_username %>,</p>
  <p>
    We've updated how refund policies work on Gumroad. Instead of individual product policies, all your products now use a single account-level policy,
    which is set to <strong><%= @seller.refund_policy.title %></strong>, effective <%= @postponed_date.present? ? @postponed_date.to_fs(:formatted_date_full_month) : "immediately" %>.
  </p>
  <% if @postponed_date.present? %>
    <p>
      <strong>Note!</strong>
      Please refer to these instructions on <%= @postponed_date.to_fs(:formatted_date_full_month) %>.
    </p>
  <% end %>
  <p>
    This means every product in your account automatically follows this same refund policy for new purchases.
    It also means that—soon—we'll be able to handle refund requests on your behalf, saving you time and energy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two refund policy options will be available:
    <ul>
      <li>30-day money back guarantee</li>
      <li>No refunds allowed</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I set different refund policies for different products?</strong><br>
    No, all your products will share the same refund policy to simplify the experience for you and your customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I use an old refund policy fine print?</strong><br>
    Yes! You can find an old refund policy fine print on a receipt from a previous sale. Receipts can be found under <%= link_to "Sales", customers_url %>.<br>
    Open the sale drawer and look for the <em>Email received</em> section at the bottom of the drawer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I change my refund policy?</strong><br>
    Yes, you can switch between the two options anytime using the instructions above. The new policy will apply to all new purchases.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What happens to existing purchases?</strong><br>
    Purchases made before this change will keep their original refund policy that was in place at the time of purchase.

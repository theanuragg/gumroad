    You are now able to share <%= @product_name %> with your audience. For every sale you make, you will get <%= @affiliate_percentage_text %> of the total sale as your commission.
  </p>
  <h3>How do you share products with your audience?</h3>
  <p>
    You can direct them to this link:
    <%= link_to @affiliate_referral_url, @affiliate_referral_url, clicktracking: "off" %>
    <% if @direct_affiliate.products.count > 1 || @direct_affiliate.destination_url.present? %>
      â€” after they click, we'll redirect them to
      <%= link_to @final_destination_url, @final_destination_url, clicktracking: "off" %>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <% if @products.count == 1 %>
        Or, if you'd like to share the product, you can use this link:
      <% else %>
        Or, if you'd like to share individual products, you can use these links:
      <% end %>
      <ul>
      <% @products.each do |product| %>
        <li>
          <strong><%= product[:name] %></strong>
          <span> - Your commission: <%= product[:fee_percent] %>%</span>
          <br>
          <%= link_to product[:referral_url], product[:referral_url], clicktracking: "off" %>
        </li>
      <% end %>
      </ul>
    <% end %>
  </p>
  <%= render("notify_affiliate_footer") %>

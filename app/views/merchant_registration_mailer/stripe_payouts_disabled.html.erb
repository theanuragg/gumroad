  <h2>Your payouts are paused</h2>
  <p>We have temporarily paused payouts on your account because our payments processor requires more information about you. Since we're subject to their policies, we need to ask you to submit additional documentation.</p>
  <p>To resume payouts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Submit the required documentation on your <p><%= link_to "payments settings page", settings_payments_url %></p></li>
    <li>We'll review your information</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once the verification is successful, we'll immediately start processing your payouts again.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>

  <p>Hi there,</p>
  <p>My name is Sahil. I'm part of the Gumroad team, and we power the payment process you tried to complete recently.</p>
  <p>I got a notification that you attempted to purchase <%= @product.name %> using PayPal, but it looks like the transaction ultimately did not go through.</p>
  <p>Sometimes your PayPal statement will say 'pending' even in this scenario â€” rest assured, this will go away in a few days' time.</p>
  <p>Please try again by clicking here (if it still doesn't go through, please try with another credit card):</p>

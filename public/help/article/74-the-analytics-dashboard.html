                        <p>Once you've started accruing sales, you'll want to learn more about your customers and where
                            they came from to help you reach out in the right places. We've designed our analytics
                            platform to make it easy to understand and act on the data that matters.</p>
                        <h2 id="Terms-to-know-UxK3S">Terms to know</h2>
                        <h3>Conversion rate</h3>
                        <p>When a customer buys your product, they are considered to have "converted" from being a
                            prospective buyer to a customer.</p>
                        <p>Your "conversion rate" is the number of people who viewed your product over the number of
                            people who actually bought it. If 10 people view your product and 5 end up buying it, your
                            conversion rate would be 50%.</p>
                        <h3>Direct sales</h3>
                        <p>This will show up in your Analytics page as Direct, Email, IM, but this is, unfortunately,
                            not the entire story. Here's a direct guide to the things that can mean "Direct":</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mobile devices or apps</li>
                            <li>Email</li>
                            <li>Twitter clients (Tweetdeck, Hootsuite, bit.ly, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Instant messengers (Skype, Gchat, etc.)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 id="Diving-into-the-data-E-Y2C">Diving into the data</h2>
                        <h3>Selecting products</h3>
                        <p>By default, data for all of your products is shown in the <a
                                href="https://app.gumroad.com/dashboard/sales">Sales Analytics Dashboard</a>. This
                            allows you to get an overview of all your Gumroad products.</p>
                        <p>If you'd like to dig deeper into the sales of a particular product (or group of products),
                            you can select the products you'd like to view by clicking the drop-down filter from the top
                            of the page.</p>
                        <p>You can also toggle data for your product selections by clicking "Toggle selected" at the
                            bottom of the filter list.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/62469212c1e53608cf9ef35d/file-Hq8M9GB3iH.png"
                                style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; "></p>
                        <h3>Selecting the date range</h3>
                        <p>By default, analytics shows data from the past month; however, it's often necessary to view
                            sales data over a more extended period. From the date picker in the top right, you can
                            access any range of data you'd like to view, going back to your first sale.</p>
                        <p>The data in the sales chart, referrer list, and location will be updated to reflect the
                            period you choose.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/64bf9636a9d61472afe09529/file-5EEqngjHHA.png"
                                style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; "></p>
                        <p>You can also toggle between daily and monthly views to get the best of both analytic worlds:
                            the close-up and the big picture.</p>
                        <h3>Sales chart</h3>
                        <p>Sales data for the period you've selected is shown as a combined graph. Each bar represents a
                            single day. The light grey section of the bar represents the number of views.</p>
                        <p>A line graph of sales volume is overlaid on top to give you a sense of sales volume relative
                            to your views.</p>
                        <p>Hover on any day to see more information about the sales, views, and absolute sales value in
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/6246932342ba434a7afe2278/file-V5ESJfaXNp.png"

                        <h2 id="Referrers-WBsBP">Referrers</h2>
                        <p>A referrer is the original source of a visit to your product.&nbsp;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you share a link to your product on Twitter and a customer follows the link to your
                                product page, the referrer would be Twitter. Similarly,&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>If someone searches for your product on Google and then visits your product page, the
                                referrer will be Google.For sales made through Gumroad Discover, the referrer will be
                                listed as "Recommended by Gumroad."</li>
                            <li>If the referrer is just "Gumroad," this indicates that the customer first visited
                                another page on Gumroad (not via Discover) before viewing your product.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All referrers to the selected product are shown in the referrers list. The number of views,
                            purchases, and conversion percentage, as well as the absolute dollar amount of sales for
                            each referrer, are shown here. You can sort this list by any of these metrics.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5c4657ad2c7d3a66e32d763f/images/624693d2c1688a6d26a7c11f/file-Zfg8pFmBDi.png"

                        <p>To help you learn about your following, we show the approximate location of your customers in
                            a table based on the IP of the purchase.</p>
                        <p>You can see the views, the number of sales, and the dollar amount sold from each location in
                            the country. You can also sort the table based on those columns.</p>
                        <p>If you're in the U.S., we also allow you to switch to the 'United States' view from the
                            'World' view by clicking on the drop-down on the right. This will enable you to see the
                            breakdown from the different states. At this time, we only show state-specific sales in the
                            United States.</p>

                        <h2 id="sales-csv">Exporting a customer sales CSV</h2>
                        <p>You can download a CSV file of your customers and their purchases within a selected date
                            range from the <a href="https://app.gumroad.com/customers">Sales tab</a>. This CSV will
                            cover all sales of your products within the date range, or you can choose to download
                            information about a single product. If the CSV is not immediately available for download, it
                            will be emailed to you.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Note: Your Gumroad Analytics and Customers dashboards use your local time zone to display and
                            filter orders. However, your CSV uses UTC time (Coordinated Universal Time). We recommend
                            that you add a one-day buffer to the beginning and end of your date range before exporting
                            to ensure that you capture all orders.</p>
